# 0. Introduction

We're going to build a very simple room booking server in Haskell, and
expose the API through an HTTP interfaces that roughly corresponds with
some REST principles (* although not all of them).

We won't be building a pretty user interface to go on the front, and
several other features are going to be missing. But hey we only have a
few hours.

This tutorial is a bit of a variety pack, introducing a whole pile of
assorted techniques and libraries, none in much depth.
